#summary Step-by-step tutorial for creating a custom test results viewer

= Introduction =

This tutorial is intended for Reflex Unit users who are interested in creating their own custom components for displaying test results. Results can be "displayed" in many ways including visual interfaces comprised of graphs and text, plain text that print to the console, or even components that send data via a socket to an external application (e.g. the Eclipse plug-in).

For the purposes of this tutorial we will be using a handful of MX charting components to demonstrate various ways in which test data could be displayed visually to a user/developer Since these components are included with the Flex framework, we won't dive too deeply into their uses/syntax. Instead, our primary goal is to create a solid foundation upon which a developer could expand when creating his or her own custom viewer.
