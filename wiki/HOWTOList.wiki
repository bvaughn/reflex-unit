= Enabling Metadata =
In order to enable metadata support for Reflex Unit, do the following:
 # Right click on the project and select "Properties"
 # Go to the "Flex Compiler" tab

You may need to clean you project after making this change in order for it to apply.

= Reflex Unit Developers: Setting Up a Local SVN Checkout =

== Configuring Project Directory ==
If you're using the Flex Builder plugin with Subclipse, then this will not be an issue. If you're using Tortoise SVN though, you'll want to do the following:
 # Navigate to the root of your project directory
 # Right click on the "bin" folder and select: "Tortoise SVN" -> "Add to ignore list" -> "bin"

== Generating/Updating Documentation ==
In order to generate project docs from a local SVN checkout simply run the following terminal command from the root of the project:
{{{
asdoc -source-path . -doc-sources . -output docs
}}}

== Setting SVN Mime-Types ==
 # Using Tortoise SVN, rick click on your local checkout and go to "Tortoise SVN" -> "Settings"
 # In the "General" tab, click on the "Edit" button beside "Subversion configuration file"
 # Make sure the following lines are in the file (and are not commented out)
{{{
enable-auto-props = yes
[auto-props]
*.gif = svn:mime-type=image/gif
*.png = svn:mime-type=image/png
*.jpg = svn:mime-type=image/jpeg
*.htm = svn:mime-type=text/html
*.html = svn:mime-type=text/html
}}}
