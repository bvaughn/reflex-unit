#summary Checklist of features currently (or soon-to-be) under development

= Flex Framework =

== Write more and better unit tests ==
 * Test all of the reflection explicitly; (no tests should fail as a sign of success)
 * Test all meta-data
 * Test parallel execution thoroughly

== Continuous Integration Output ==
{{{
<testsuites>
  <testsuite name="package_name::ClassName">
    <testcase name="methodName" time="0.0"/>
    ...
  </testsuite>
  ...
</testsuites>
}}}

 * What about failed tests? How much (and what type of) information is needed?

= Eclipse Plugin =
 * Scan project folder for tests files
  * Folder and file naming conventions
  * Optionally parse class metadata
 * Define socket communication protocol
 * Hot-link to failed unit tests
