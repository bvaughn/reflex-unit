#summary Checklist of features currently (or soon-to-be) under development

== Flex Framework ==

=== Get !JavaDoc output generated ===
 * Settle on a format and get those docs posted!

=== Write more and better unit tests ===
 * Test all of the reflection explicitly; (no tests should fail as a sign of success)
 * Test all metadata
 * Test parallel execution

=== !FlexMock style support available for all dynamic classes ===
  * Offer rails-style .all, .new_instances, .exactly_once, .at_least_once, etc.
  * Implement this using getter methods that return a reference to the Class (or singleton) itself but also mark Boolean flags inside to check
  * Wrap specified functions in dynamically declared functions to ensure execution

=== Remove requirement for tests to extend !TestCase ===
  * ~~Create new !TestRunner class that wraps test and handles running~~
  * ~~Make methods in !TestCase public-static and able to be _called by_ tests, (perhaps multiple tests in parallel)~~
  * ~~Get rid of the concept of an ITest?~~

=== Expand metadata to support the following ===
  * ~~!TestCase - _methods not beginning with 'test' may still be designated as tests with this meta tag_~~
  * ~~shouldFail = true|false - _this test is expected to result in a `failure` (not an `error`)_~~
  * ~~forceSerialExecution = true|false - _asynchronous test should block other tests until completion_~~


=== Multiple asynchronous tests can execute in parallel ===

  * ~~Queue up a series of strong event listeners such that (potentially) all asynchronous tests within a !TestCase can execute in parallel~~
  * ~~This must defer to the optional _forceSerialExecution_ metadata arg~~


== Eclipse Plugin ==
