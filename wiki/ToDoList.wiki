#summary Checklist of features currently (or soon-to-be) under development

== Flex Framework ==

=== Expand metadata to support the following ===

  * shouldFail = true|false - _this test is expected to result in a `failure` (not an `error`)_
  * forceSerialExecution = true|false - _asynchronous test should block other tests until completion_


=== Multiple asynchronous tests can execute in parallel ===

  * Queue up a series of strong event listeners such that (potentially) all asynchronous tests within a !TestCase can execute in parallel
  * This must defer to the optional _forceSerialExecution_ metadata arg


=== !FlexMock style support available for all dynamic classes ===

  * Offer rails-style .all, .new_instances, .exactly_once, .at_least_once, etc.
  * Implement this using getter methods that return a reference to the Class (or singleton) itself but also mark Boolean flags inside to check
  * Wrap specified functions in dynamically declared functions to ensure execution

== Eclipse Plugin ==
